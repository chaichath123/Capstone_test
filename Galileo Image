==  Instruction of Preparing a Bootable SD card

(1) format a MicroSD card with FAT file system

(2) extract image files
    In a Linux teminal, use the following command:
    $ tar zxvf galileo-sd-image.tar.gz

    You should be able to see a new directory name "galileo-sd-image" created.
    The following files are in that directory:

	boot/grub/grub.conf
	bzImage
	core-image-minimal-initramfs-clanton.cpio.gz
	image-full-galileo-clanton.ext3

(3) copy the files onto the MicroSD card (assume it is mounted at /media/9090-3333)
    $ cp -r galileo-sd-image/* /media/9090-3333
  
    You may need to use different copying commands if not on Linux.


== Boot Yocto Linux on Galileo

(1) insert the MicroSD card to the MicroSD slot on an Intel Galileo board

(2) connect serial-USB cable(s) between Galileo and a computer

(3) use a Terminal program on the computer to interact with the Galileo via the serial port

(4) power on the Galileo board

You should be able to see the boot messages from Galileo. You can then login using
user name "root" without password needed.
